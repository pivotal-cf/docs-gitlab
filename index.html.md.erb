This is documentation for [GitLab Enterprise Plus for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF)](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-gitlab).

<p class="note warning"><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: As of September 13, 2017, Gitlab no longer supports the ongoing maintenance 
  of the BOSH-deployable Gitlab tile available on Pivotal Network. 
  While Pivotal and Gitlab continue to collaborate on creating a new Kubernetes-based tile, the current tile is at End-of-Life (EOL). 
  Pivotal is working with Gitlab to develop a customer migration and support plan for affected commercial customers.</p>
